# Azure VS OpenAI

## Overview
This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks that serve different purposes in comparing the differences between the APIs from Azure and OpenAI.

## Notebooks Description

1. **AzureVSOpenAI.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: This notebook is used to compare responses from Azure and OpenAI models on various topics, particularly focusing on astronomical objects like Sagittarius A* and TON 618.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Extracts and displays information about celestial objects.
     - Compares textual information in a structured format.

2. **Similarity.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: Designed to calculate and analyze the similarity between texts using multiple methods including stylistic, structural, and BERT-based embeddings.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Implements functions to calculate stylistic and structural features of texts.
     - Uses BERT embeddings to compute semantic similarity.
     - Provides comprehensive similarity assessments combining multiple metrics.

3. **TestOfRobustness.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: Tests the robustness of text similarity measures under various scenarios and text structures.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Includes detailed examples and explanations of different text comparison scenarios.
     - Evaluates the performance of similarity measures on texts with varying styles and contents.
     - Demonstrates practical applications of similarity measures in understanding text related to economics, astronomy, and AI.
