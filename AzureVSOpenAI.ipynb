To give you a perspective, one light-year is approximately 5.88 trillion miles, so imagine the sheer distance we're talking about here! Sagittarius A* is about four million times the mass of our Sun.

To paint a picture for you, imagine a sleeping giant who only occasionally wakes up for a meal. However, don't let its current state fool you. Astronomers believe that Sagittarius A* was once very active and may have played a significant role in the formation and evolution of our galaxy.\n",

It's home to one of the largest known black holes in the universe, a true monster. The black hole at the center of TON 618 is estimated to be 66 billion times the mass of our Sun.

To bring this into perspective, imagine the weight of 4.1 million celestial giants like our Sun, all concentrated in a single point.

Think of it as a beacon of light shining across the cosmos. TON 618 is one of the most massive known black holes in the universe, with an estimated mass of 66 billion times that of our Sun. This is equivalent to the mass of 66 billion Suns squeezed into a single point. Imagine the gravitational pull that this tremendous mass exerts on its surroundings. The distance between TON 618 and Earth is staggering, as it is located about 10.4 billion light-years away. So, the light we see from TON 618 today actually started its journey towards us 10.4 billion years ago.\n",

Here, amidst a dazzling sea of stars, lies a cosmic behemoth—a supermassive black hole known as Sagittarius A* (pronounced \"Sagittarius A-star\"). This celestial giant is invisible in the regular spectrum of light, but astronomers can detect its presence by observing the stars and gas clouds swirling around it, much like water circling a drain before plunging in.\n",

In more familiar terms, if you could travel at the speed of light (about 670 million mph), it would still take you 26,000 years to get there from Earth. Sagittarius A* has a mass roughly 4 million times that of our Sun. Imagine our Sun, which accounts for about 99.86% of the Solar System's mass, and then multiply that heft by 4 million. Yet, for all its mass, the event horizon (the point beyond which nothing can escape its gravitational pull) is only about 17 times wider than the Sun. If you could somehow replace the Sun in our solar system with Sagittarius A*, it would fit comfortably inside the orbit of Mercury with vast room to spare.\n",

      "Now, let's journey beyond our galaxy to meet a true cosmic titan, TON 618. This is a quasar, the incredibly bright core of a galaxy where a supermassive black hole resides, actively devouring material and spewing out immense amounts of energy. TON 618 is one of the largest black holes ever discovered, and it's located an astonishing 10.4 billion light-years from Earth. To give you a sense of this distance: if you started traveling to TON 618 at the speed of light just after the Earth was formed, you wouldn't even be halfway there by now.\n",
      "\n",
      "TON 618 has a mass about 66 billion times that of our Sun. To put that in perspective, it's as if you combined the mass of every star in the Milky Way, then did it again multiple times. Despite its mass, we can't directly see TON 618. What we actually observe is the quasar it powers, shining as one of the brightest objects in the universe due to the superheated material spiraling into the black hole's maw. The scale of this luminosity is hard to fathom, but imagine the Sun, then picture something billions of times brighter, and you start to get the idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, both Sagittarius A* and TON 618 serve as awe-inspiring examples of the universe's extremes. From the relatively modest yet still mind-boggling supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way to the staggering, almost incomprehensible scale of TON 618, these cosmic phenomena challenge our understanding and expand our sense of the vastness that surrounds us. Through them, we glimpse not only the immense diversity of the cosmos but also the incredible scales over which it operates—reminding us of the universe's endless capacity to astonish and inspire.\n"
